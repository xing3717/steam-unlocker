OpenSteamTool is a Windows DLL project built with CMake.

## Feature

### Core Unlocks
- Unlock an unlimited number of unowned games.
- Unlock all DLCs for unowned games.
- Support auto load depot decryption keys from Lua config.
- Support auto manifest download via `steamrun` / `wudrm` upstream APIs(default is `wudrm`), or a custom Lua endpoint (see [Manifest via Lua](#manifest-via-lua)).
- Support downloading protected games or DLCs that require an access token.
- Support binding manifest to prevent specific games from being updated.

### Hot Reload
- Adding, modifying, deleting, or overwriting `.lua` files in any watched directory automatically triggers a reload. No restart, no offline/online toggle needed.

### Family Sharing and Remote Play
- Bypass Steam Family Sharing restrictions, allowing shared games to be played without limitations.

### Compatible with games protected by Denuvo and SteamStub
- For AppTicket and ETicket: in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\{AppId}`, both `AppTicket` and `ETicket` are `REG_BINARY` values.
- Use `setAppTicket(appid, "hex")` and `setETicket(appid, "hex")` in Lua config to write these values to the registry automatically.
- SteamID priority: read `SteamID` as `REG_SZ` (numeric-only) first; if missing, parse from `AppTicket`.

### Stats and Achievements
- Enable stats and achievements for unowned games.
- Uses `setStat(appid, "steamid")` to configure which SteamID's achievement data to pull.
- If no `setStat` is configured for an app, falls back to the hardcoded default SteamID `76561198028121353`.

### Online Fix
- Add `-onlinefix` to the Steam launch parameters to enable 480-based online play in games that use lobby matchmaking. The current limitation is that only one such game can run at a time.To revert, simply remove -onlinefix from the launch parameters — online play returns to normal on the next launch.

## Future
- For games protected by Denuvo and SteamStub, find a safe timing to switch `GetSteamID` (see `src/Hook/Hooks_IPC.cpp#Handler_IClientUser_GetSteamID` TODO) so save files are not affected.(**Suggestions welcome — when is the earliest point after game initialization that we can safely switch the
  SteamID without affecting save file binding?**)
- Steam Cloud synchronization support.(This is a huge project)
- Add Auto Denuvo Authorization Sharing for Legitimate Accounts.

## Usage
1. Run `build.bat` from the project root to build the project.
2. Copy generated `dwmapi.dll`, `xinput1_4.dll` and `OpenSteamTool.dll` to the Steam root directory.
3. Create Lua directory (for example `C:\steam\config\lua`) and place Lua scripts there. The DLL will automatically load and execute them.
4. Lua example:
```lua
addappid(1361510) -- unlock game with appid 1361510

addappid(1361511, 0,"5954562e7f5260400040a818bc29b60b335bb690066ff767e20d145a3b6b4af0") -- unlock game with appid 1361511 depotKey is "5954562e7f5260400040a818bc29b60b335bb690066ff767e20d145a3b6b4af0" 

addtoken(1361510,"2764735786934684318") -- add access token ("2764735786934684318") for game with appid 1361510 
-- No Longer Supported:
--pinApp(1361510) -- pin game with appid 1361510 to prevent it from being updated

setManifestid(1361511,"5656605350306673283") -- pin depotid:1361511 manifest_gid:5656605350306673283, size defaults to 0
setManifestid(1361511,"5656605350306673283", 12345678) -- same but with explicit size

setAppTicket(1361510,"0100000000000000...") -- write AppTicket (REG_BINARY) to HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\1361510\AppTicket

setETicket(1361510,"0100000000000000...") -- write ETicket (REG_BINARY) to HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\1361510\ETicket

setStat(1361510, "76561197960287930") -- use the specified SteamID's achievement data for appid 1361510
-- If not configured, default SteamID 76561198028121353 is used.
```

All function names are **case-insensitive**. `setAppTicket`, `setappticket`, `SetAppticket`, `SETAPPTICKET` etc. are all equivalent. The same applies to every registered function (`addAppId`, `AddToken`, `SETManifestid`, etc.).

### Configuration (optional)

Rename `opensteamtool.example.toml` to `opensteamtool.toml` and place it in the Steam root directory (next to `steam.exe`).
If no config file is found, built-in defaults are used — no auto-creation.

```toml
[log]
# Debug build only.  Level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
level = "info"

[manifest]
# Upstream API for depot manifest request codes.  Options: "steamrun", "wudrm"
url = "steamrun"

# HTTP timeouts for manifest requests (milliseconds)
timeout_resolve_ms = 5000
timeout_connect_ms = 5000
timeout_send_ms    = 10000
timeout_recv_ms    = 10000

# Additional Lua config directories (optional).
# Files are loaded after the default <Steam>/config/lua folder.
# The default folder is always loaded last so user files take priority.
[lua]
paths = []
```

### Manifest via Lua

Two manifest code functions are supported:

#### `fetch_manifest_code(gid)`

Basic function that receives only the manifest GID.

#### `fetch_manifest_code_ex(app_id, depot_id, gid)` *(recommended)*

Extended function that receives `app_id`, `depot_id`, and `gid`. Allows constructing API endpoints that require app identification.

The C++ runtime provides two Lua helpers:

| Function | Signature | Returns |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `http_get`  | `http_get(url [, headers])`       | `body, status_code` |
| `http_post` | `http_post(url, body [, headers])` | `body, status_code` |

`headers` is an optional table: `{["Key"]="Value", ...}`.

### Debug logging

Debug builds write per-module log files under `<Steam>/opensteamtool/`:

| File | Source | Content |
|------|--------|---------|
| `main.log`          | General | Init, config loading, Lua parsing,Utils |
| `ipc.log`           | `LOG_IPC_*` | IPC commands, InterfaceCall dispatch, spoofing |
| `netpacket.log`     | `LOG_NETPACKET_*` | Network packet send/recv, eMsg dispatch |
| `manifest.log`      | `LOG_MANIFEST_*` | Manifest download, `fetch_manifest_code`,manifest binding |
| `decryptionkey.log` | `LOG_DECRYPTIONKEY_*` | Depot decryption key injection |
| `keyvalue.log`      | `LOG_KEYVALUE_*` | KeyValues patching (manifest binding) |
| `misc.log`          | `LOG_MISC_*` | Engine pointer capture, AppId hints |
| `winhttp.log`       | `LOG_WINHTTP_*` | HTTP requests  |
| `achievement.log`   | `LOG_ACHIEVEMENT_*` | UserStats requests/responses, steamid spoofing |
| `pics.log`          | `LOG_PICS_*` | PICS access token injection |
| `package.log`       | `LOG_PACKAGE_*` | Package injection, FileWatcher events |
| `onlinefix.log`     | `LOG_ONLINEFIX_*` | Online fix (480 AppId spoofing) |

The log level is controlled by `[log] level` in `opensteamtool.toml`.
